# 📚 Dictionary Compression Interactive  

An educational tool designed to help students explore and understand how dictionary-based data compression works. Through this interactive experience, students will learn the fundamentals of compression techniques in an engaging and practical way.  

---

## ✨ Overview  

This project provides a hands-on activity where students:  
- Learn about **dictionary-based compression** (e.g., LZW, Huffman Coding basics).  
- Explore the concept of encoding and decoding words using a dictionary.  
- Gain insights into how data compression reduces file size without losing information.  

**Created for Mr. Watson’s class at Bridgeland High School.**  

---

## Built With  

- **HTML**: Structure for the interactive activity.  
- **CSS (Tailwind CSS)**: Styled for a clean, modern look.  
- **JavaScript**: Implements the logic for encoding and decoding, as well as interactive features.  

---

## Features  

- **Interactive Compression Process**:  
  - Encode a sample text using a dictionary and see the compression in action.  
  - Decode the compressed text to understand how the original data is restored.  

- **Visual Feedback**:  
  - Color-coded outputs for easier understanding of encoded and decoded values.  
  - Real-time updates as students modify inputs.  

- **Educational Content**:  
  - Brief explanations of dictionary-based compression concepts.  
  - Step-by-step guides embedded into the interface.  

- **Tailored for High School Students**:  
  - Simplified examples and clear visualizations to ensure accessibility.
